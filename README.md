# 📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python, SQL, and Power BI.
The goal is to load and clean a dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), extract insights using SQL, and present findings through an interactive dashboard and professional reports.

The project showcases practical skills that are commonly required for data analyst roles.

## 📂 Dataset

* The dataset is loaded and analyzed using **Python**
* Contains structured data suitable for analysis and reporting
* Cleaned to handle:

  * Missing values
  * Duplicate records
  * Inconsistent formats

*(Dataset details can be updated here if needed)*

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* **PostgreSQL** (SQL queries and data extraction)
* **Power BI** (Dashboard creation)
* **Gamma** (Report & presentation creation)
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Git & GitHub**
